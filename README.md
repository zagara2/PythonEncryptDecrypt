# PythonEncryptDecrypt

## What is it?

A data transformation assignment I completed while studying computer science at Duke University.

Instructions for the assignment were as follows:

"Part 1: Pig-latin

In this part you will translate text to Pig-latin by reading a file, and then writing the piglatin translation to a new file. You'll then write code to read a file in pig-latin and translate it back to English.

Part 2: Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption

In this part you will read in a file and encrypt the file using the Caesar Cipher technique, writing the encrypted version of the text to a new file. You will also write several decrypt methods to translate the encrypted file back into an English file. Sometimes you will know the key to decrypt the file and other times you will need to break the encryption by determining the key."
